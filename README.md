# How to Get Unbanned on Paladins (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned from Paladins can feel like stepping on a big ol’ digital landmine — especially if you swear you were just minding your own business! This simple guide will help you figure out why you might have been banned and how to appeal your ban with the best shot at getting your account back in the game.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you find yourself banned the moment you rolled a fresh account? Or maybe the ban follows you like a bad smell no matter how many accounts you make? You could be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! Paladins occasionally flags your computer hardware, so even a shiny new account can’t help you play.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Peep any emails or Paladins notifications to discover the ban reason. Typical culprits include:
- Cheating, hacking, or using sketchy third-party tools  
- Toxic or downright nasty behavior  
- Account sharing or suspicious activity flagging  

**Pro Tip:** Always check Hi-Rez’s Terms of Service before firing off an appeal email.
